#### Summary:

Automated machine learning ,AutoML helps by streamlining the machine learning process thereby allowing non-technical users to harness the power of machine learning. Here, I have tried to build my own AutoML app using streamlit, which takes in any CSV data and runs random forest classification model on it to get the acccuracy and the F1 scores. It also has grid search with hyperparamter tuning and you can see how thw number of parameters and features affect the model.
Make sure you check out the *requirements.txt* file, it lists all the packages used to make the streamlit app.

Streamlit allows you to host 3 apps for free so feel free to sign up and host your own ML apps!
